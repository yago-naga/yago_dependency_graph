 Svg graph computation:
 - The follow-up extractors of another follow-ups extractors are not added.
 
 Provenance:
 - Display the fact on the provenance page (not so straightforward modification).
 - Try to speed up provenance computation.
 
 Preview:
 - Get rid of 1000-limit for the number of facts displayed in the preview (pagination? just remove?).
 - Add a reasonable preview for the data files.
 
 
 General:
 - Introduce 'public' names for themes (so that names like '...veryDirty' are not displayed to users).
 - Check that opening external editor works on Windows (the proper command should be specified in the init file).
 - Create a HOWTO for getting a fresh running project instance.
 
 SVG interface:
 - Clicking 'Show dependent extractors' for the second time with another extractor doesn't change highlight but cancels it.
 	(Should be cancelled only when we click for the second time on the same extractor).
 - Highlighting doesn't affect the arrow endings.

 	
 Cleanliness:
 - Get rid of urls hard-coded in templates and scripts.
  
  
  
DONE:
   [- (?) Create an automatic script for cutting the themes so that they contain only rows related to objects possibly useful in the demo presentation.
  (Speed up computations so that the user/presenter doesn't have to worry about unwillingly triggering costly extraction).]
