'''Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima''' ({{IPA-pt|ʁoˈnawðu ˈlwiʒ nɐˈzaɾju dʒ ˈɫĩmɐ|local}}; born 18 September 1976&lt;ref&gt;According to &quot;Ronaldo : the journey of a genius&quot; by James Mosley, Ronaldo was born on 18 September, but was registered on 22 September&lt;/ref&gt;) commonly known as '''Ronaldo''', is a retired [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] [[Association football|footballer]]. Popularly dubbed &quot;the phenomenon&quot;, he is considered by experts and fans as one of the greatest football players of all time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.castrolfootball.com/legends/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://soccerlens.com/top-100-greatest-ever-footballers/3888|title=Top 100 Greatest Ever Footballers}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, he was voted [[Goal.com]]'s &quot;Player of the Decades&quot; in an online poll of the Spanish version of the website, gathering 29.55% of all votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/es/news/2686/debates/2011/05/22/833309/debate-qui%C3%A9n-es-el-mejor-jugador-de-la-historia |title=Debate: ¿Quién es el mejor jugador de la Historia? |language={{es icon}} |publisher=Goal.com |date=23 May 2010 |accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won his first [[Ballon d'Or]] as the European Footballer of the Year in 1997 and won the award again in [[Ballon d'Or 2002|2002]]. He is one of only three men to have won the [[FIFA Player of the Year]] award three times, along with [[Zinedine Zidane]] and [[Lionel Messi]].

Considered by many as the most complete [[striker]] in the past 30 years, in 2007, he was named as one of the best starting 11 of all-time by [[France Football]] and was named to the [[FIFA 100]], a list of the greatest footballers compiled by [[Pelé]]. In 2010, he was voted [[Goal.com]]'s &quot;Player of the Decade&quot; in an online poll, gathering 43.63 percent of all votes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/2804/goalcom-player-of-the-decade/2010/01/01/1719502/ronaldo-is-goalcoms-player-of-the-decade|title=Ronaldo Is Goal.com's Player of the Decade|author=Goal.com team|date=1 January 2010|work=Goal.com|publisher=[[Goal.com]]|accessdate=11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also included as centre forward in the &quot;Team of the Decade&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/2804/goalcom-player-of-the-decade/2009/12/28/1713063/goalcom-player-of-the-decade-results-position-by-position|title=Goal.com Player of the Decade: Results – Position By Position &amp; The Team of the Decade Revealed|author=Goal.com team|date=28 December 2009|work=Goal.com| publisher=Goal.com|title=ESPN-soccernews|accessdate=11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 February 2010, Ronaldo announced that he would retire after the 2011 season, signing a two-year contract extension with the Corinthians at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=745706&amp;sec=global&amp;cc=5739|title=Ronaldo sets retirement date|accessdate=23 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronaldo has played for [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in 98 international matches, scoring 62 goals. He was a part of the Brazilian squad that won the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]] and [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]]. During the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], Ronaldo became the [[FIFA_World_Cup_goalscorers#Overall_top_goalscorers|highest goalscorer]] in the history of the World Cup with his fifteenth goal, surpassing [[Gerd Müller]]'s previous record of 14. He is the only player to have won the World Cup [[FIFA World Cup awards|Golden Ball]] and [[FIFA World Cup awards|Golden Boot]] in separate tournaments. Having suffered a string of serious injuries throughout his career, Ronaldo retired on 14 February 2011, citing [[pain]] and [[hypothyroidism]] as the reasons for his premature retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/noticia/2011/02/emocionado-ronaldo-revela-hipotiroidismo-e-da-adeus-ao-futebol.html |title=Emocionado, Ronaldo atribui adeus às dores e ao hipotireoidismo |accessdate=14 February 2011 |date=14 February 2011 |publisher=Globo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2009}}

===1993: Cruzeiro===
In 1993, Ronaldo began his football career playing for [[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube|Cruzeiro]] which was already going on to become a successful club. In his first and only year with Cruzeiro, he amassed 12 goals in 14 appearances and led them to their first [[Copa do Brasil]] championship. Prior to this, he was turned down by his boyhood favourite team [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo|Flamengo]], but Brazilian World Cup legend [[Jairzinho]] saw Ronaldo's potential and helped get him the move to Cruzeiro.

===1994–1996: PSV Eindhoven===
Ronaldo chose to join [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] after the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]], for he was selected despite being just 17, but did not play. It was [[Romário]] who advised Ronaldo to start his European career at PSV; Romário being a former striker of the team from 1988 to 1993. Ronaldo scored 30 league goals in his first season in the Netherlands. His second season was marred by a knee injury which kept him out of most of the campaign, but he still averaged nearly a goal a game in the league, scoring 12 goal in 13 appearances. With PSV, Ronaldo won the [[Dutch Cup]] in 1996 and he was Eredivisie top scorer in 1995.

===1996–1997: Barcelona===
During his spell at PSV, Ronaldo attracted the attention of both [[Inter Milan]] and [[FC Barcelona]]. It was Barcelona that was willing to pay the then record fee of $17&amp;nbsp;million. During the [[1996–97 La Liga|1996–97 season]], Ronaldo scored 47 goals in 49 games (in all competitions) for Barcelona, leading the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] side to [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1996-97|UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] triumph (where he capped the season with the winning goal in the cup final itself) and to [[Copa del Rey]] and [[Supercopa de España]] wins. He also won [[La Liga]] top scorer award in 1997 with 34 goals in 37 games. Until the [[2008–09 La Liga|2008–09 season]], Ronaldo remained the last player to score more than 30 goals in La Liga. At the age of 20, Ronaldo became the youngest player to win [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] in 1996. He also finished runner-up for the [[Ballon d'Or]].
[[File:PSG-Barcelone 1997.png|thumb|Ronaldo scoring the winning penalty in the [[1997 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final]] against [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]].]]

===1997–2002: Inter Milan===
Ronaldo's time at Barça was brief, as there were problems with the renegotiation of Ronaldo's contract. Ronaldo's unhappiness became evident and at the end of the season, by paying the buy out clause fee in his contract, [[Inter Milan]] signed him in the summer of 1997 for a then world record fee of £19&amp;nbsp;million. He had spent just one year with Barcelona.

Ronaldo duly helped them repeat his former side's cup-winning run, this time in the [[1997-98 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], in which he scored their third goal in the [[1998 UEFA Cup Final|final]] itself.
[[File:Ronaldo Cannes.jpg|thumb|upright|Ronaldo at the [[1999 Cannes Film Festival]]]]
Ronaldo adapted to the Italian style of the game in his first season, finishing second on the league's scoring charts. Ronaldo started to develop into a complete forward. He began racking up assists, became first-choice penalty taker, taking and scoring freekicks, and captaining the team at the end of the season. During his time with Inter, he scored several goals against city rivals [[A.C. Milan]] in the [[Derby della Madonnina]]. He won FIFA World Player of the Year for the second time in 1997, and collected the Ballon d'Or the same year. The following year, after the [[FIFA World Cup]], he finished second for FIFA player of the year, and third for European Footballer of the Year. At this point in his career, he was clearly and widely regarded as the best player in the world.

On 21 November 1999, during a Serie A match against [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]], Ronaldo felt his knee buckle and was forced to limp off the pitch. Medical exams after the match confirmed that the striker had ruptured a tendon in his knee and would require surgery.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballdatabase.com/index.php?page=player&amp;Id=1044&amp;b=true&amp;pn=Lu%C3%ADz_Naz%C3%A1rio_de_Lima |title=Ronaldo (Luíz (Ronaldo) Nazário de Lima) – Milan and Brazil |publisher=Footballdatabase.com |accessdate=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his first comeback on 12 April 2000, he played only seven minutes during the first leg of the [[Coppa Italia]] final against [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] before injuring his knee for a second time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inter.it/en/societa/storia.html |title=F.C. Internazionale Milano |publisher=Inter.it |accessdate=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ronaldo's recurring injury problems forced him to miss the entire [[2000–01 Serie A|2000-01 season]] and much of the two seasons either side of it. After two operations and months of rehabilitation, Ronaldo came back for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], helping Brazil win their fifth World Cup title. Later in 2002, he won the [[FIFA World Player of the Year|World Player of the Year]] award for the third time, and transferred from Inter to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]. Ronaldo was given his most recognizable nickname, {{lang|pt|''Il Fenomeno''}}, by the Italian press while playing there. He was named the 20th top footballer of all time for Inter, according to Times Online, and only his injuries prevented a higher ranking. He played 99 games and scored 59 goals for ''Nerazzurri''.

===2002–2006: Real Madrid===
[[File:Ronaldo em campo.jpg|thumb|upright|Ronaldo playing for [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], 21 December 2005.]]
Having signed for [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] for €46&amp;nbsp;million, his jersey sales broke all records on the first day, such was the obsession and hype surrounding him. He was sidelined through injury until October 2002 but the fans kept on chanting his name. Ronaldo scored twice in his debut for Real Madrid. He received a standing ovation at the [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium|Stadium Bernabéu]]. That same reception was observed on the night of the final game of the season against [[Athletic Bilbao]], where Ronaldo scored again to seal his first season with 23 league goals and the [[La Liga|La Liga Championship]] title for 2003. With Madrid, he also won an [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] in 2002 and [[Supercopa de España|Spanish Super Cup]] in 2003.
[[File:Ronaldo Real Madrid.jpg|thumb|left|Ronaldo taking a shot for [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], 2 March 2005]]
In the second leg of Real Madrid's Champions League quarter-final, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at [[Old Trafford]], knocking the English team out of the competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ronaldo ends Man Utd dream&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Ronaldo ends Man Utd dream |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/champions_league/2965089.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=23 April 2003 |accessdate=25 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronaldo was substituted on 80 minutes and was given a standing ovation from both sets of fans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ronaldo ends Man Utd dream&quot;/&gt; Madrid was on track to win the treble, until Ronaldo was injured towards the end of the [[2003–04 La Liga|2003–04 season]]; they subsequently lost the Copa del Rey final,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Real Madrid 2–3 Real Zaragoza |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2004/mar/18/newsstory.sport3 |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian Media Group |date=18 March 2004 |accessdate=25 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; were knocked out of the [[UEFA Champions League]] quarter-finals, and suffered a league form breakdown. That season, he finished as the league's top scorer with 24 goals and was awarded the [[Pichichi Trophy]], despite Madrid losing the league title to [[Valencia CF]]. With the acquisition of [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]] in 2006, Ronaldo grew more and more out of favour with the manager [[Fabio Capello]] due to injuries and weight issues.

In April 2013, he was named by [[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]] as a member of the &quot;Best foreign eleven in [[History of Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid's history]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/2013/04/11/en/football/real_madrid/1365709938.html|title=The best foreign eleven in Real Madrid's history|date=12 April 2013|publisher=Marca.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007–2008: AC Milan===
On 18 January 2007, it was reported that Ronaldo agreed terms with [[A.C. Milan]] for a transfer of €8.05&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/news/kind=1/newsid=501832.html|title=Ronaldo unveiled by Rossoneri|date=30 January 2007|publisher=UEFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronaldo was forced to pay for the remaining period on his contract which tied him to Real Madrid, only because the latter did not agree to release him, while AC Milan were not ready to pay such a sum. On 25 January, Ronaldo flew from [[Madrid]] to [[Milan]] to watch the team play in a cup tie against [[A.S. Roma|Roma]]. Statements on the club's website said that Ronaldo was in Milan for a medical, and that a meeting had been arranged for Monday with Real Madrid officials to discuss and finalize his transfer to the Milanese club. On 26 January, Ronaldo successfully completed his medical tests at the Milanello training complex under the supervision of club doctors, and the transfer completed on 30 January&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/6271487.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Milan complete signing of Ronaldo | date=30 January 2007 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and got the squad number 99. He made his debut as a substitute on 11 February 2007, during the 2–1 victory over [[A.S. Livorno Calcio|Livorno]]. The next game at [[A.C. Siena|Siena]], on 17 February, Ronaldo scored twice and assisted on a third goal in his first start for AC Milan, as they won an exciting game 4–3. In his first season, Ronaldo scored seven goals in 14 appearances.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

After his move to AC Milan, Ronaldo joined the list of the few players to have played for both Inter Milan and AC Milan in the [[Derby della Madonnina]], and is one of two players to have scored for both sides in the derby game (for Inter in the [[1998–99 Serie A|1998–99 season]] and for AC Milan in the [[2006–07 Serie A|2006–07 season]]), the other player being [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]]. Ronaldo is also one of the few players to have started for [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and [[FC Barcelona]], which also boasts a [[Real Madrid#Rivalry with FC Barcelona|heated rivalry]]. Ronaldo, however, has never transferred directly between rival clubs. Ronaldo only played 300-plus minutes in his single season at AC Milan due to recurring injury problems and weight issues. Ronaldo's only goals in the [[2007–08 Serie A|2007–08 season]], besides his goal against [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]] in pre-season, came in a 5–2 victory against [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] at the [[San Siro]], where he scored an emotional brace. It was also the first time AC Milan's much hyped attacking trio of [[Kaká]], [[Alexandre Pato]] and Ronaldo, known as ''Ka-Pa-Ro'', played together. In total, he scored nine goals in 20 appearances for AC Milan.

Despite tremendous success over the past decade, Ronaldo has never won the [[UEFA Champions League]] in his club career. During the 2006–07 season, though AC Milan won the [[UEFA Champions League 2006-07|2006–07 title]], Ronaldo was [[cup-tied]] with Madrid and ineligible to take part. The closest that he has been was in 2003 when he helped Real Madrid to the semi-finals, in which they lost to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]].

On 13 February 2008, Ronaldo suffered a severe season-ending knee injury while jumping for a cross in AC Milan 1–1 draw with Livorno, and was stretchered off and taken to a hospital. The club confirmed after the match that Ronaldo had ruptured the [[Patellar ligament|kneecap ligament]] in his left knee. It marked the third such occurrence of this injury, which he suffered twice to his right knee in 1998 and 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/7244079.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Milan fear for Ronaldo's career | date=14 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released by AC Milan at the end of the season, as his contract expired and was not renewed.

===2009–2011: Corinthians===
[[File:Gaviões da Fiel - Ronaldo.jpg|thumb|Ronaldo in 2010]]
Ronaldo trained with [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo|Flamengo]] during his recovery from knee surgery, and the club's board of directors said that the doors were open for him to join. On 9 December, however, Ronaldo signed a one-year deal with Flamengo's league rival [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/ronaldo-agrees-to-join-corinthians-1058987.html Independent.co.uk] Ronaldo agrees to join Corinthians&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement received high publicity in the Brazilian press about his favouring Corinthians over Flamengo, since Ronaldo publicly declared himself a Flamengo lover and had promised to defend the club.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goal.com/en/articolo.aspx?contenutoid=684403 Goal.com] Ronaldo: No Milan? I'll Go To Flamengo&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronaldo played his first match for Corinthians on 4 March 2009, a [[Copa do Brasil]] match against [[Itumbiara Esporte Clube|Itumbiara]] at [[Estádio JK|Estádio Juscelino Kubitschek]], in which he came as a substitute for [[Jorge Henrique de Souza|Jorge Henrique]].&lt;ref name=&quot;itumbiara&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title = Aos 22min do 2º tempo, Ronaldo estréia pelo Corinthians| url = http://esportes.terra.com.br/futebol/copadobrasil/interna/0,,OI3614269-EI1950,00-Aos+min+do+tempo+Ronaldo+estreia+pelo+Corinthians.html| publisher=Terra| date = 4 March 2009| accessdate =4 March 2009|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronaldo scored his first goal for Corinthians on 8 March 2009 in a [[Campeonato Paulista]] match against [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras|Palmeiras]].&lt;ref name=&quot;firstgoalcorinthians&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title = Com gol de Ronaldo no final, Corinthians arranca empate contra o Palmeiras| url = http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/esporte/ult92u531293.shtml| publisher=Folha Online| date = 8 March 2009| accessdate =8 March 2009|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped Corinthians win the Campeonato Paulista with 10 goals in 14 games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-05/16/content_11383489.htm News.Xinhuanet.com], {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronaldo helped Corinthians defeat Internacional with an aggregate score of 4–2 to help the club win its third Brazil Cup (the second of his career), thus earning a spot in the Copa Libertadores 2010. He returned on 20 September in a match against [[Goiás Esporte Clube|Goiás]]. On 27 September 2009, he scored for Corinthians in the 1–1 draw against [[São Paulo FC]]. He finished the [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A 2009|Brazilian Serie A 2009]] with 12 goals in 20 matches.
In February 2010, Ronaldo signed a contract extension with Corinthians that would keep him with the club until the end of 2011, and said he would then retire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2010/02/22/sports/sports-uk-soccer-latam-brazil-ronaldo.html|title=Ronaldo Renews Corinthians Contract, Will Retire In 2011|date=22 February |publisher=Reuters}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, after Corinthians were eliminated from the 2011 Copa Libertadores by the [[Colombia]]n team [[Deportes Tolima]], Ronaldo announced his retirement from football.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/corinthians/noticia/2011/02/para-jornal-ronaldo-confirma-o-fim-da-carreira-esta-na-hora.html|title=Ronaldo confirma o fim da carreira (In Portuguese)|date=13 February |publisher=GloboEsporte|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/9397354.stm|title=Ronaldo's troubled farewell |date=14 January 2011|work=BBC Sport |accessdate=14 February 2011|first=Daniel|last=Gallas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/880463/emotional-ronaldo-confirms-retirement-from-football?cc=5739|title=Ronaldo confirms retirement |date=14 January 2011|work=ESPN Soccernet|accessdate=14 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In an emotional press conference on 14 February 2011, he admitted his body had finally succumbed to the crippling litany of injuries that have blighted his career. &quot;It's very hard to leave something that made me so happy. Mentally I wanted to continue but I have to acknowledge that I lost to my body,&quot; he stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/feb/14/ronaldo-retires-lost-to-my-body|title=Ronaldo admits in emotional retirement address: 'I lost to my body'|date=14 January 2011|work=Guardian|accessdate=14 February 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1356787/Ronaldo-retire-football-Brazil-legend-concedes-battle-fitness.html|title=Tearful Ronaldo retires as Brazil legend concedes long battle against fitness|date=14 January 2011|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=14 February 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Ronaldo made his international debut for [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in 1994, in a friendly match in [[Recife]] against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]. He went to the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] in the United States as a 17-year-old, but did not play. He came to be known as '''Ronaldinho''' (&quot;little Ronaldo&quot; in Portuguese), because [[Ronaldo Rodrigues de Jesus]], his older teammate on the tournament, was also called Ronaldo and also nicknamed '''Ronaldão''' (&quot;big Ronaldo&quot;) to further distinguish them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/mar/14/the-knowledge-most-games-played|title=WAS RONALDO ORIGINALLY CALLED RONALDINHO?|date=14 March 2012|author=Rob Bagchi and Rob Smyth|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Brazilian player, [[Ronaldinho|Ronaldo de Assis Moreira]], who is widely known as Ronaldinho, would come to be called Ronaldinho [[Rio Grande do Sul|Gaúcho]] when he joined the Brazilian main national team in 1999.

In the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympic Games]] in [[Atlanta]], Ronaldo played with the name ''Ronaldinho'' on his shirt, since centre back [[Ronaldo Guiaro]], two years his senior, was one of his teammates. Brazil went on to win the bronze medal.

===1998 FIFA World Cup===
He entered the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] and was billed by reporters and experts as the world's greatest footballer. He scored four goals and made three assists. The night before the final, he suffered a [[Epileptic seizure|convulsive fit]]. At first, Ronaldo was removed from the starting lineup 72 minutes before the match, but he requested to play and was later reinstated by coach [[Mario Zagallo]]. Ronaldo's performance was below par and he was injured in a collision with French goalkeeper [[Fabien Barthez]]. Brazil lost the final to hosts [[France national football team|France]] 3–0.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnnsi_fit&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

| date = 15 July 1998
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Adrian Williams, professor of clinical neurology at [[Birmingham University]], said that Ronaldo should not have played, saying that he would have been feeling the after effects of the seizure and that &quot;there is no way that he would have been able to perform to the best of his ability within 24 hours of his first fit – if it was his first fit.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnnsi_neurologist&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2002 FIFA World Cup===
During the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], Ronaldo again led the national team to their record fifth championship and won the [[FIFA World Cup awards|Golden Shoe]] as top scorer with eight goals and was runner-up to the [[FIFA World Cup awards|Golden Ball]] as most valuable player in the tournament. He also scored against every opponent in the tournament except in the quarter-finals against [[England national football team|England]]. In the final match against [[Germany national football team|Germany]], Ronaldo scored his 11th and 12th goals to a round of applause and tied [[Pelé]]'s Brazilian record of 12 career World Cup goals.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes_applause&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

===2006 FIFA World Cup===
On 2 June 2004, Ronaldo scored an unusual [[hat-trick]] of penalties for Brazil against arch-rivals Argentina in a [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|2006 World Cup qualifying match]].

At the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], although Brazil won their first two group games against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] and [[Australia national association football team|Australia]], respectively, Ronaldo was repeatedly jeered for being overweight and slow. Nonetheless, coach [[Carlos Alberto Parreira]] kept him in the starting lineup in face of calls to have Ronaldo replaced. With his two goals against [[Japan national football team|Japan]] in the third match, he became the 20th player ever to score in three different FIFA World Cups and also equalled the all-time World Cup finals scoring record of 14, held by [[Gerd Müller]] (Ronaldo scored at [[1998 FIFA World Cup|France 98]], [[2002 FIFA World Cup|Korea/Japan 2002]] and [[2006 FIFA World Cup|Germany 2006]]). and then broke Müller's record in the Round of 16 match against [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] by scoring his 15th World Cup goal. He also equalled a much-less-talked-about mark: with his third goal of the 2006 World Cup, Ronaldo became only the second player ever, after [[Jürgen Klinsmann]], to score at least three goals in each of three World Cups. Brazil, however, were knocked out by France 1–0 in the quarter-finals.

Ronaldo and Klinsmann's record of at least three goals in each of three World Cup finals has now been both equalled and bettered by the German [[Miroslav Klose]], who now has a record of at least four goals in each of three tournaments, having netted five at both the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 finals]], and four at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 tournament]].

===Farewell match===
In February 2011 it was announced that Ronaldo will be given one very last match for Brazil, five years after his last match with the national team, a friendly against [[Romania national football team|Romania]] was held in [[São Paulo]] on 7 June 2011. Despite it being almost unheard of in international football for players to be given farewell matches for their national side, CBF officials have stated that given the extraordinary career of Ronaldo, it is only fitting that his last hurrah should take place in Brazil while representing his nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/news/newsid=1391398.html Ronaldo to receive Seleção swansong]. FIFA.com (2011-03-02). Retrieved on 3 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He played for 15 minutes in a match that ended with a Brazilian victory with a single goal from [[Frederico Chaves Guedes|Fred]] at the 21st minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gonzalez|first=Roger|title=Brazil 1–0 Romania: Neymar shines as hosts secure win in Ronaldo's farewell match|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/match/59878/brazil-vs-romania/report|work=Goal.com|accessdate=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/926698/brazil-win-as-ronaldo-bows-out?cc=5739|title=Brazil win as Ronaldo bows out|date=8 June 2011|work=ESPN Soccernet |accessdate=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goalscorer Fred celebrated his goal with Ronaldo's famous 'finger wag' celebration along with his Brazilian teammates who joined in as well. When Ronaldo was introduced to the pitch around the thirty minute mark, he had three shots on target which were saved by the Romanian keeper, [[Ciprian Tătăruşanu]]. As soon as the first half was over, Ronaldo made a speech to the crowd at the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/soccer/blog/dirty-tackle/post/Ronaldo-laughs-off-misses-in-his-final-match-for?urn=sow-wp2333|title=Ronaldo laughs off misses in his final match for Brazil|work=Yahoo Sports |accessdate=23 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1997, Ronaldo met the Brazilian model and actress [[Susana Werner]] on the set of Brazilian [[telenovela]] ''[[Malhação]]'' when they acted together in three episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Ronaldo's profile at IMDB | url = http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1046596/ | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] | accessdate =24 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Susana Werner's profile at IMDB | url = http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0921482/ | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] | accessdate =11 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although never marrying, they began a long-term relationship and lived together in [[Milan]] until the beginning of 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Susana Werner, love in Milan {{pt icon}} | url = http://www.lancenet.com.br/noticias/09-01-29/477266.stm?susana-werner-amor-em-milao | publisher=[[Lance!]] | date = 29 January 2009 | accessdate =24 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In April 1999, Ronaldo married [[Brazil women's national football team|female Brazilian footballer]] [[Milene Domingues]], at the time pregnant with the couple's first son, Ronald. The marriage lasted four years. The couple had a son, Ronald (born in [[Milan]], on 6 April 2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/news/2002/08/31/ronaldo_facts_reuters |title= Fast facts on Ronaldo | publisher=[[CNN Sports Illustrated]] |date=31 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Ronaldo became engaged to Brazilian model and [[MTV Brasil|MTV]] VJ [[Daniela Cicarelli]], who became pregnant but suffered a miscarriage; the relationship lasted for only three months after their luxurious wedding at the [[Château de Chantilly]]. The ceremony reportedly cost £700,000 (€896,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-05/12/content_441435.htm |title= Ronaldo splits up with fiancee|work=China Daily |date=12 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the three, however, André Luís Ribeiro Albertini (better known as ''Andréia Albertini''), demanded $30,000 and exposed the case to the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-564540/Two-transvestite-prostitutes-admit-Ronaldo-allegations-false.html |title=Two of the transvestite prostitutes say that Ronaldo's allegations are false| work=Daily Mail |date= 7 May 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the local police chief, &quot;[Ronaldo] was very excited and wanted to go out and have fun, without the press knowing.
